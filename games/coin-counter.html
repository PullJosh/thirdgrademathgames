		<p>After clicking play, a few coins will be set on the table. You must determine the amount of money the coins are worth. Then, type the total in the box on the bottom of the screen. (Type the number of cents, not dollars. For example, if there were three quarters, you would type 75, not $0.75) Once typed, press the checkmark or tap the enter key to submit your answer.</p>
		<p>After answering 10 questions, you will be shown your score. Try to get 10/10!</p>
