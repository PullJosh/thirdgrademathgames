        <p>Your goal in the irregular area game is to find the area of a shape composed of rectangles. Whenever you're asked a question, simply enter the answer and see if you were right!</p>
        <p>There are two levels. To pass each level, you'll need to get 10 questions right. But be warned! If you don't answer correctly on your first attempt, you won't gain a point.</p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
