		<p>In this game, you must estimate the location of a specified fraction. The closer you are to the correct location, the more points you receive.</p>
		<p>Each level has a target number of points you must reach in order to pass. Reach this number of points in just six questions, and you move to the next level. If you don't get enough points, it's game over.</p>
		<p>Your score for the current level is shown in the bottom left, along with the target score for that level. After answering a question, the amount of points you got for that question alone is shown in parentheses. Your progress is shown on the top of the screen.</p>
		<p>Click to place the marker where you believe the fraction lies, and then press the button in the bottom right to submit your answer.</p>
